# Headings

Although there are lots of ways to get a heading, the easiset is with the hash (#) symbol.

    # A level one heading
    ## A level two heading
    ### A level three heading
    
# A level one heading
## A level two heading
### A level three heading

#Lists

### Unordered lists can be achieved using a variety of symbols (*, - or +)

    * Item
    * Item
    * Item

* Item
* Item
* Item

### Ordered lists use numbers, but the order is automatically corrected on export

    1. Item 1
    2. Item 2
    3. Item 3
    6. Item 4
    2. Item 5

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
6. Item 4
2. Item 5


#Code

###If you want to write code you just add a tab (4 space) before each line

    foo = 6
    bar = 4
    foo = foo + bar
    bar = foo - bar
    foo = foo - bar

#Links

###Write links like this

    [ayylmao](loli.dance)

[ayylmao](loli.dance)

#Images

###Images can be added to your markdown using a similar format to links

    ![alt text for image](relative/location/of/image.jpg)
    
![alt text for image](relative/location/of/image.jpg)

So for instance if my markdown was in a directory, that itself contained a directory called images, where my pictures were stored.
